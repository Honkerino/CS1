				<h1>Gameplay</h1>
						<div>
							<p>The Knight can explore the large interconnected world of Hallownest using a variety of movement and combat techniques.<br>
							In classic Metroidvania style, there are areas of the world that the Knight cannot access until they obtain particular Items or Abilities.<br>
							Maps for each area must be bought from a shopkeeper generally hidden somewhere in that area,<br>
							and the Knight can also buy upgrades that place markers on the map or allow them to reveal parts of the map as they explore.<br>
							Many areas have a 'boss' enemy that the Knight must defeat in order to continue, and have a number of sub-bosses that drop useful rewards or upgrades.<br>
							Defeated enemies drop Geo, a currency that the Knight can use to buy items from shopkeepers. 
							If the Knight is killed, they respawn at the last place they rested and lose all their Geo.<br>
							They must then return to their place of death and defeat their Shade in order to recover the currency. <br>
							The Knight also gains SOUL by attacking enemies, which they can then spend to recover lost health or activate special abilities. <br>
							Health can also be recovered at Hot Springs, which are located around the world, or by resting at a Bench.</p>
